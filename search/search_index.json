If you just want to build it, run the build command: you:~/hello_world$ cabin build Finished debug target(s) in 0.00866317s Cabin uses a cache since we executed the command with no changes. [!TIP] To use a different compiler, you can export a CXX environmental variable: shell export CXX=g++-13 Install dependencies Like Cargo does, Cabin installs dependencies at build time. Cabin currently supports Git, path, and system dependencies. You can use two ways to add dependencies to your project: using the cabin add command and editing cabin.toml directly. [!WARNING] - Cabin currently supports building a project with header-only dependencies. - Building with build-required dependencies will be soon supported. [!NOTE] A header-only library is a type of library where the entire functionality is contained within header files, and no additional compilation steps are required. This means you can directly include the library's headers in your project without needing to link against any compiled binaries. These libraries require the headers to be in the root or include/ directory. This ensures that the library's header files are accessible in a predictable location for easy inclusion in your project. Here are some links that can help you find header-only libraries: - https://github.com/topics/single-header - https://github.com/topics/header-only - https://github.com/p-ranav/awesome-hpp cabin add The cabin add command accepts the following arguments: cabin add <package names ....> --<options> Options: - --sys : Marks the packages as system dependency (requires the --version argument) - --version : Specify dependency version. Only used with system dependencies - --rev : Specify revision for git dependencies - --tag : Specify tag for git dependencies - --branch : Specify branch for git dependencies Example cabin add libgit2 --sys --version \"1.1.0\" cabin add \"ToruNiina/toml11\" --rev \"846abd9a49082fe51440aa07005c360f13a67bbf\" Editing cabin.toml directly The syntax for cabin.toml is as follows: [dependencies] # git dependency \"ToruNiina/toml11\" = { git = \"https://github.com/ToruNiina/toml11.git\", rev = \"846abd9a49082fe51440aa07005c360f13a67bbf\" } # path dependency local_lib = { path = \"../local_lib\" } # system dependency fmt = { version = \">= 9\", system = true } If tag , branch , or rev is unspecified for git dependencies, Cabin will use the latest revision of the default branch. System dependency names must be acceptable by pkg-config . The version requirement syntax is specified in src/VersionReq.hpp . After adding dependencies, executing the build command will install the package and its dependencies. you:~/hello_world$ cabin build Downloaded ToruNiina/toml11 846abd9a49082fe51440aa07005c360f13a67bbf Compiling src/main.cc Linking hello_world Finished debug target(s) in 0.70s Unit tests You can write unit tests in any source files within the src directory. Create a new file like: src/Lib.cc int add(int a, int b) { return a + b; } #ifdef CABIN_TEST # include <cassert> int main() { assert(add(1, 2) == 3); // ok assert(add(1, 2) == 4); // fail } #endif Now, with the test command, you can run tests defined within CABIN_TEST : you:~/hello_world$ cabin test Compiling src/Lib.cc Linking tests/test_Lib Testing Lib Assertion failed: (add(1, 2) == 4), function main, file Lib.cc, line 13. make: *** [test] Abort trap: 6 Unit tests with the CABIN_TEST macro are useful when testing private functions. Integration testing with the tests directory has not yet been implemented. Run linter Linting source code is essential to protect its quality. Cabin supports linting your project by the lint command: you:~/hello_world$ cabin lint Linting hello_world src/main.cc:0: No copyright message found. You should have a line: \"Copyright [year] <Copyright Owner>\" [legal/copyright] [5] Done processing src/main.cc Total errors found: 1 Error: `cpplint` exited with status 1 [!TIP] If you do not have cpplint , install it with the following command: bash pip install cpplint The lint command works without configurations, and Cabin would automatically opt out of unwanted lints by adjusting to each project. To customize the lint settings, try adding the [lint.cpplint] key in your cabin.toml like this or creating a CPPLINT.cfg file in the repository root. Run formatter Cabin also supports formatting your source code with clang-format . Ensure having installed clang-format before running this command. you:~/hello_world$ cabin fmt Formatting hello_world [!NOTE] This command automatically detects what files we need to format to avoid getting bothered by commands like: console $ # We need to avoid the `build` dir and such dirs ... $ clang-format ./src/*.cpp -i $ clang-format ./include/**/*.hpp -i $ clang-format ./tests/**/*.cpp -i $ ... To customize the format settings, try creating a .clang-format file to the repository root. Run clang-tidy Cabin also supports running clang-tidy on your source code.
